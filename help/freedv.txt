FreeDV HF Modes

These are designed for use with a HF SSB radio.

| Mode  | Date | Codec       | Modem                                | RF BW |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ----- |
| 1600  | 2012 | Codec2 1300 | 14 DQPSK + 1 DBPSK pilot carrier     | 1125  |
| 700C  | 2017 | Codec2 700C | 14 carrier coherent QPSK + diversity | 1500  |
| 700D  | 2018 | Codec2 700C | 17 carrier coherent OFDM/QPSK        | 1000  |
| 700E  | 2020 | Codec2 700C | 21 carrier coherent OFDM/QPSK        | 1500  |

| Mode  | Raw bits/s | FEC            | Text bits/s | SNR min | Multipath |
| ----- | ---------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------- | --------- |
| 1600  | 1600       | Golay (23,12)  | 25          |  4      | poor      |
| 700C  | 1400       | -              | -           |  2      | good      |
| 700D  | 1900       | LDPC (224,112) | 25          | -2      | fair      |
| 700E  | 3000       | LDPC (112,56)  | 25          |  1      | good      |

Notes:

* "Raw bits/s" is the number of payload bits/s carried over the channel by the
  modem.  This consists of codec frames, FEC parity bits, unprotected text,
  and synchronisation information such as pilot and unique word bits.  The
  estimates are open to interpretation for the OFDM waveforms due to pilot
  symbol and cyclic prefix considerations (see spreadsheet).

* "RF BW" is the bandwidth of the RF signal over the air.  FreeDV is more
  bandwidth efficient than SSB.

* "Multipath" is the relative resilience of the mode to multipath fading,
  the biggest problem digital voice faces on HF radio channels.  Analog SSB
  would be rated as "good".

* "Text" is a side channel for low bit rate text such as your location and
  call sign.  It is generally unprotected by FEC, and encoded with varicode.
  The exception is if reliable_text support is turned on
  (see reliable_text.c/h); this results in text protected by LDPC(112,56) FEC
  with interleaving.

* "SNR Min" is for an AWGN channel (no multipath/fading).

* All of the modems use multiple parallel carriers running at a low symbol
  rate of around 50 Hz.  This helps combat the effects of multipath channels.

* Some of the Codec 2 modes (2400/1300/700C etc) happen to match the name of a
  FreeDV mode.  For example FreeDV 700C uses Codec 2 700C for voice compression.
  However FreeDV 700D also uses Codec 2 700C for voice compression, but has
  a very different modem waveform to FreeDV 700C.  Sorry for the confusing
  nomenclature.

* Coherent demodulation gives much better performance than differential, at
  the cost of some additional complexity.  Pilot symbols are transmitted
  regularly to allow the demod to estimate the reference phase of each carrier.

* The 1600 and 700C waveforms use parallel tone modems, later modes use OFDM.
  OFDM gives tighter carrier packing which allows higher bit rates, but tends
  to suffer more from frequency offsets and delay spread.

* At medium to high SNRs, FreeDV 700C performs well (better than 700D) on fast
  fading multipath channels with large delay spread due its parallel tone design
  and high pilot symbol rate.  It employs transmit diversity which delivers
  BER performance similar to modes using FEC.  FreeDV 700C also has a short
  frame (40ms), so syncs fast with low latency.  Fast sync is useful on marginal
  channels that move between unusable and barely usable.

* FreeDV 700D uses an OFDM modem and was optimised for low SNR channels, with
  strong FEC but a low pilot symbol rate and modest (2ms) cyclic prefix which
  means its performance degrades on multipath channels with fast (> 1Hz) fading.
  The use of strong FEC makes this mode quite robust to other channel
  impairments, such as static crashes, urban HF noise, and in-band interference.

* FEC was added fairly recently to FreeDV modes.  The voice codecs we use work
  OK at bit error rates of a few %, and packet error rates of 10%. Raw bit error
  rates on multipath channels often exceed 10%.  For reasonable latency
  (say 40ms) we need small codewords. Thus to be useful we require a FEC code
  that works at over 10% raw BER, has 1% output (coded) bit error rate, and a
  codeword of around 100 bits.  Digital voice has unusual requirements, most FEC
  codes are designed for data which is intolerant of any bit errors, and few
  operate over 10% raw BER.  Powerful FEC codes have long block lengths
  (1000's of bits) which leads to long latency.  However LDPC codes come close,
  and can also "clean up" other channel errors caused by static and
  interference. The use of OFDM means we now have "room" for the extra bits
  required for FEC, so there is little cost in adding it, apart from latency.

FreeDV VHF Modes

These modes use constant amplitude modulation like FSK or FM, and are designed
for VHF and above.  However 800XA can be run over HF or VHF on a SSB radio.

| Mode  | Date | Codec2 | Modem              | RF BW     |
| ----- | ---- | ------ | ------------------ | --------- |
| 2400B | 2016 | 1300   | baseband/analog FM | analog FM |
| 800XA | 2017 | 700C   | 4FSK               | 2000      |

| Mode  | Raw bits/s | FEC           | Text bits/s |
| ----- | -----------| ------------- | ----------- |
| 2400B | 2400       | Golay (23,12) | 50          |
| 800XA | 800        | -             | N           |

FreeDV 2400B mode

FreeDV 2400B is a mode designed for VHF radio. FreeDV 2400B is designed to pass
through commodity FM radios.
